            <h2>The Dawn of Tetris</h2>
            <p>Tetris was invented in 1984 by Alexey Pajitnov, a young researcher at Moscow's Academy of Science. Inspired by a puzzle board game called "Pentomino", Alexey set out to create a digital version with a twist: the puzzle pieces, instead of being passive, fell down the playing field in real-time.</p>

            <p>With the help of his colleagues, Dmitry Pavlovsky and Vadim Gerasimov, the game rapidly grew in popularity. It crossed the boundaries of the Soviet Union and soon became one of the most recognized and played video games worldwide.</p>
